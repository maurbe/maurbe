### About

Hi there, I am Mauro, an astrophysicist and data scientist by training with a passion for coding and everything AI-related. I love to explore new ways to visualize complex data sets and research results. Find out more through my CV below. When I am not working on projects, you will probably find me outdoors, training handstands or reading a good book. Feel free to reach out, whether it's serious business or just for a friendly hi!

My Academic CV can be found [here (December 2025)](https://maurbe.github.io/static/CV_academic-79759c9a72db90709904446cb40e4492.pdf).
