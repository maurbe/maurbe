### About

Hello, I'm Mauro, working in Computer Science at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/de.html) in the [Department for Astrophysics](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/) in the group of Professor [Robert Feldmann](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/~feldmann/). My research interests orbit around Machine/Deep Learning applications in structure formation such as the cosmic web and galaxy formation and the physics of Active Galactic Nuclei.

My CV can be found [here (July 2024)](https://maurbe.github.io/home/src/cv_july_24.pdf).
